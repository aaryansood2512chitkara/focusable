### Overview:

An iOS app written in Swift. Focusable is a productivity timer and tracker to improve the quality of your work and keep you focused. Maximise your productivity while avoiding burnout. The goal of this project is to learn how to develop an iOS application, from the design through to the deployment to the applestore.

Available on the AppStore [here](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/timerable/id1475531432)

### How does it work?
You choose a subject you want to work under and then the timer will start for 25 minutes, and you'll work on that task. Then a 5-minute break to procrastinate. After 4 of these focused work sessions a longer break of 30 minutes to help reduce burnout and retain your focus on busy days. 

The app offers complete customisation. All of the timings, the session length and your daily goal can all be changed to your liking. The defaults are just a recommendation, use what works for you!

Stat tracking helps you understand how you're spending your focused work time, and when you're working. Also, you can totally use it to brag about how hard you worked.

Both Dynamic Type and VoiceOver are both supported for accessability.

### Future Roadmap: 

Feature | Explanation
------------ | -------------
Watch App | A supplimentary watch app that'll allow you to look at the current time of your session and allow you to pause and resume for unexpected breaks that may need to be taken.
iPad App | Port the visuals and the codebase to an iPad app since studying isn't always done on the same device. This would include syncing the *CoreData* model across the users iCloud account.
