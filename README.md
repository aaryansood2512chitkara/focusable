# Pomodoro
An iOS app written in Swift. The goal is to create a configurable pomodoro method timer to aid me in focusing when I study. The goal of this project is to learn how to develop an application which scales to all iOS screen sizes.

## Future Roadmap 

Feature | Explanation
------------ | -------------
Notifications | Add scheduled *UserNotifications* to allow the app to be backgrounded without any impact on battery life, implementing a fastforward method that on launch will update the state of the app to where it should be.
Graphed Statistics | Add a graph that filers by the last 7 days to show how much you've been working each day that week to help visualise how you're studying.
Study Goals | Add daily/weekly study targets to help motivate the user to study and complete their work.
iPad App | Port the visuals and the codebase to an iPad app since studying isn't always done on the same device. This would include syncing the *CoreData* model across the users iCloud account.
